EWW:

- Checkout the *Hyprland Wiki* for the dependencies required for the *workspace widget to work.*
- To have the same icons I do, you need the *Cozette* (HiDpi version) font.

Things are very messy, and I haven't bothered committing to cleaning it up yet because I'm still working on some stuff. Clone at your own risk. \
I mean, nothing catastrophic will happen. Your eyes just might get cursed.
