# Notes

Polybar is an old and shitty config that someone requested. It's left here, because why not.

# Hyprland """rice"""" notes

- Checkout the **Hyprland Wiki** for the dependencies required for the **EWW workspace widget to work.**
- To have the same icons I do, you need the **Cozette** (HiDpi version) font.
- There are a lot of other dependencies that you'll need to check for in these configs.

Things are very messy, and I haven't bothered committing to cleaning it up yet because I'm still working on some stuff. Clone at your own risk. \
I mean, nothing catastrophic will happen. Just that, your eyes just might get cursed.
