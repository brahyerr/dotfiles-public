# Notes

Polybar is an old and shitty config that someone requested. It's left here, because why not.

# Hyprland """rice"""" notes

Things are very messy, and I haven't bothered committing to cleaning it up yet because I'm still working on some stuff. Clone at your own risk. \
I mean, nothing catastrophic will happen. Just that, your eyes just might get cursed.

- Checkout the **Hyprland Wiki** for the dependencies required for the **EWW workspace widget to work.**
- To have the same icons I do, you need the **Cozette** (HiDpi version) font.
- There are a lot of other dependencies that you'll need to check for in these configs.
- If you have a hard time going through my EWW config, check out **https://github.com/rxyhn/tokyo**.
    - It's what my own is based off of, anyways.
